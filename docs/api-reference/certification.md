`Certification` is the top-level resource that defines a suite of certification categories to run against a GPU node pool.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: nvcre.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: Certification
metadata:
  name: gpu-cluster-cert
  namespace: nvcre
spec:
  target:
    nodeSelector:
      nvidia.com/gpu.present: "true"
  enableMNNVL: false
  categories:
    - domain: communication
      variant: nccl-all-reduce
    - domain: training
      variant: nemotron5-8b
      options:
        maxSteps: 50
        nodesPerJob: 8
```

## Spec fields

_Generated from CRD schema — coming soon._

<Warning>
`spec.categories` is **immutable** after the Certification is created (`self == oldSelf` validation). To change the category list, delete the Certification and recreate it. The minimum is 1 category.
</Warning>

## Status fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `conditions` | []Condition | InProgress, Succeeded, Failed (mutually exclusive) |
| `categoryStatuses` | []CertificationCategoryStatus | Per-category status including `domain`, `variant`, `status`, `workflowRef`, `succeededNodesRef`, and `failedNodesRef` |

Each `categoryStatuses` entry includes a `failedNodesRef` — a `TypedLocalObjectReference` pointing to a ConfigMap that stores the failed-node list (name, reason, message) for that category. To read the failed nodes:

```bash
# Get the ConfigMap name from the category status
kubectl get certification <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.categoryStatuses[0].failedNodesRef.name}'
# Read the ConfigMap contents
kubectl get configmap <ref-name> -o yaml
```

## Lifecycle

1. Controller creates one `Workflow` per entry in `spec.categories`. The category list cannot be changed after creation — delete and recreate to modify it.
2. Workflows run **sequentially** — the controller processes one category at a time. `maxConcurrent` controls job/group parallelism *within* a single Workflow (how many node groups run at once), not across categories.
3. When all Workflows complete, Certification is marked `Succeeded` or `Failed`.
4. Failed nodes are recorded in ConfigMaps referenced by `status.categoryStatuses[].failedNodesRef`. NVCRE does not taint or cordon nodes.
